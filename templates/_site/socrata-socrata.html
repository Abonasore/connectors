<p>This FME workflow extracts data from an existing Socrata dataset, performs an example data transformation (filtering out features by attribute value) and then publishes the resulting data to a different Socrata dataset. This workflow could be adapted to perform joins of two existing Socrata datasets using a <a href="http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Transformers/Default.htm#Transformers/featuremerger.htm">FeatureMerger</a> transformer.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to get the example workflow working to create a new dataset on your data portal.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the workflow using the Download link above and open it in FME Desktop. <strong>NOTE:</strong> You may have to right-click &gt; Save Link As… to get it to download. </li>
  <li>Ensure the CSV Reader is pointing to <code>https://data.mo.gov/api/views/wu22-kvdm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD</code> by editing the ‘Source CSV’ under <code>rows[CSV]</code> in the Navigator panel in the upper left of FME.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> verify that you can actually download the CSV when you input <code>https://data.mo.gov/api/views/wu22-kvdm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD</code> into a web browser. </li>
  <li>Update your Socrata credentials for the Socrata writer by editing the following under the Socrata writer (look for <code>&lt;not set&gt; [Socrata]</code>) in the Navigator panel:
    <ul>
      <li>Domain (e.g. data.seattle.gov)</li>
      <li>User</li>
      <li>Password</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run the workflow and ensure a new dataset was created on your domain.</li>
</ol>
