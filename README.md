### Setting Up

The site is a customized [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, so there are some steps you'll need to take care of to get your environment set up:

1. Make sure you have the `gh-pages` branch checked out: `git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages`
2. Pull in the site templates and CSS/SASS, which come from submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Make sure you have Ruby version installed. Check `.ruby-version` to see the preferred version. If you're using rbenv or rvm, this should automatically be set up
4. Install the Bundler Gem installed: `gem install bundler`
5. Set up the Gem bundle: `bundle`
6. You can then run one of several options on the `Rakefile`, depending on your setup:
    - `jekyll build` will perform a Jekyll build into `./public`. If rerun, it'll be faster since it'll only build what you have changed.
    - `jekyll build --watch` will perform an incremental build automatically when you change files, which is handy if you're using something like [Pow](https://pow.cx)
    - `jekyll serve --watch` will run a standalone server for testing

### Modifying CSS/SASS

Site styling is controlled via `css/local.sass` and it's automatically regenerated by Github Pages with each push.
